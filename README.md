**Summary**

I eat an apple almost every day. Not to keep up with any proverb about doctors, but because I just really like apples. I enjoy crunching into a crisp, fresh apple with my lunch. This means I probably eat over 300 apples a year assuming I eat 6/wk. That totals close to 100 pounds of apples a year. That's a lot of apple (and doesn't even take into count when I use them to bake even tastier things).

While I chomped through yet another apple recently, I wondered about the fluctuations, or lack thereof, in their price and availability (especially as it's the thick of winter and I have continued to see 99 cents/pounds signs occasionally at the local grocer). So I decided to look into it and here you are - an analysis of monthly apples prices from 1980 to 2010.

I use both an ARIMA model and an SVR model to examine and predict apple prices over time, while considering other possible factors as well.
